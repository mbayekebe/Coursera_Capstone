Are the boroughs and their associated neighborhoods make New York City like Toronto in terms of the venues, and categories of venues they harbor?\n",

        "### This idea will be refined here, through the use of statistical techniques that can pinpoint similarities and differences between New York and Toronto neighborhoods. This research will put emphasis on the use of data mining and machine learning techniques – Data Visualization, Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA), Correlation Analysis, Correspondence/Discriminant Analysis, and Canonical Correlation Analysis to gain insights.\n",

        "### In most part of the world, nowadays and with the advent of the Internet and smartphones, people/entities will to some extent, do their due diligence and research neighborhoods areas when planning to move from City A to City B. These stakeholders comprising of tourists, city migrant workers entities looking for new location to start office, and many others, will benefit from a user friendly information system that highlights to them similarities and differences between the two cities in terms of neighborhood venue profiles. Hence they will be able to make an informed choice beforehand and avoid costly moves.\n"
